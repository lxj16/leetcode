# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

# Add to List

# Share
# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

# Example:

# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

#     3
#    / \
#   9  20
#     /  \
#    15   7
# return its depth = 3.
